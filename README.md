# modelica_building_energy_system
This code models the power system of a 10,000 m2 building. The code is written in the Modelica language. The simulation created the dataset. The Python language was used to find anomalies and predict the target variable P_all_power. Machine learning methods were used: IsolationForest, DBSCAN,PCA, a neural network with LSTM architecture was created.
